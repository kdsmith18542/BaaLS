Deep Dive Blueprint: BaaLS Smart Contract Module
Purpose: To define the architecture and functionality of BaaLS's deterministic WASM smart contract runtime. This module is responsible for loading, sandboxing, executing, and managing the state interactions of WebAssembly smart contracts. It's the secure engine that runs the "logic painted" by Canvas Contracts.

Relationship to BaaLS Core:
The contracts module (likely libchain/src/contracts.rs and sub-modules) is used by the Ledger during StateTransition to execute contract-related transactions. It relies heavily on the Storage trait to persist and retrieve contract code and state.

Core Principles:

Security & Isolation (Sandboxing): Smart contracts must run in a highly isolated environment, preventing them from accessing or modifying unauthorized host resources (filesystem, network, arbitrary memory).

Determinism: Given the same WASM bytecode and inputs, a contract must produce the exact same output and state changes every single time, regardless of the host environment or time of execution.

Resource Metering (Gas): All computational resources consumed by a contract (CPU cycles, memory, storage access) must be measurable and capped to prevent denial-of-service attacks and ensure predictable costs.

Language Agnosticism (WASM): Leverage WASM's multi-language compilation target to support contracts written in Rust, AssemblyScript, Go (TinyGo), F#, etc., as produced by Canvas Contracts.

Predictable Interaction (WASI-like): Define a clear, constrained interface (inspired by WASI) for contracts to interact with the BaaLS host environment.

1. Contract Life Cycle & Management
Contract ID: A unique identifier for a deployed contract. This could be a hash of the deployed WASM bytecode, or a deterministically generated address upon deployment.

Deployment:

A Transaction (from the Runtime) containing WASM bytecode as its payload and a special recipient (e.g., ContractDeployerAddress) signals a contract deployment.

The Ledger calls contract_engine.deploy_contract().

deploy_contract():

Receives WASM bytes and an initial payload (for instantiate function).

Validates the WASM bytecode:

Size Limits: Enforce maximum WASM module size.

Disallowed Opcodes: Filter out non-deterministic opcodes (e.g., floating-point, external system calls not explicitly allowed via WASI).

Memory Limits: Validate initial and maximum memory pages requested by the module.

Export/Import Verification: Check that expected WASI imports are present and only allowed functions are exported.

Generates a unique ContractId (e.g., hash(deployer_address + deployer_nonce + wasm_bytes_hash)).

Stores the WASM bytecode in Storage using the ContractId as a key (e.g., contracts:code:<contract_id> -> wasm_bytes).

Initializes an empty key-value store for the contract's state within Storage (e.g., contracts:state:<contract_id>:<key> -> value).

Optionally, executes an instantiate or _start function within the WASM module if specified, passing the init_payload. This is a one-time execution to set up initial contract state.

Creates and returns a new Account::Contract entry in the Ledger's state, pointing to the ContractId and its initial storage_root_hash.

Execution (Calling a Contract):

A Transaction with tx.recipient being a ContractId and tx.payload containing serialized call data.

The Ledger calls contract_engine.execute_contract_call().

execute_contract_call():

Retrieves the WASM bytecode for contract_id from Storage.

Loads and instantiates the WASM module within the sandboxed WasmRuntime.

Gas Metering: Initializes the gas counter for the execution.

Sets up the WASI host functions for the current execution context (passing a reference to the Storage for contract-local data, the sender's public key, etc.).

Calls the specified exported WASM function (e.g., execute, call) with the payload as arguments.

Monitors gas consumption during WASM execution.

Upon completion (success or trap):

If successful, records state changes (written via WASI calls) and emitted events.

If gas limit exceeded or a WASM trap occurs, the execution reverts, and no state changes are committed.

Returns ContractExecutionResult (output data, events, gas used, status).

Querying (Read-Only Calls):

query_contract(): Similar to execute_contract_call but runs in a non-transactional, read-only mode.

No state changes are allowed or committed.

Often used for light client queries or UI dashboards.

Still subject to gas metering for spam protection, but not charged.

2. WASM Runtime Environment
Primary Runtime Choice: wasmtime (or wasmer). Chosen for its Rust-native implementation, performance (JIT compilation), and strong sandboxing capabilities.

Instantiation: Each contract execution requires instantiating the WASM module. This creates a fresh, isolated memory space and execution context for the contract.

Linear Memory: WASM operates on a linear memory model. Contracts have their own memory space, isolated from the host and other contracts. Interactions with memory outside this space are prevented by the sandbox.

Stack-Based Execution: WASM is a stack machine, which inherently lends itself to deterministic execution.

3. WASI Host Functions (The BaaLS "Blockchain System Interface")
This is the defined set of functions that BaaLS exposes to running WASM contracts, allowing them to interact with the blockchain's state and core services in a secure, controlled, and deterministic manner. These are the equivalent of "syscalls" for BaaLS.

Naming Convention: BaaLS-specific WASI functions could be prefixed (e.g., baals_).

Core Host Functions (Minimum Set):

Storage Access:

baals_storage_read(key_ptr: u32, key_len: u32, value_ptr: u32, value_len_cap: u32) -> u32 (actual_value_len): Read data from the contract's local persistent storage. Returns actual bytes read or error.

baals_storage_write(key_ptr: u33, key_len: u32, value_ptr: u32, value_len: u32): Write data to the contract's local persistent storage.

baals_storage_remove(key_ptr: u32, key_len: u32): Remove an item from storage.

Memory Pointers: WASM functions operate on integers, so complex data like strings or byte arrays are passed by reference (memory pointer + length) within the WASM module's linear memory. The host reads/writes from these pointers.

Context/Environment:

baals_get_sender(ptr: u32): Returns the PublicKey of the transaction sender into the contract's memory.

baals_get_contract_id(ptr: u32): Returns the ContractId of the currently executing contract.

baals_get_block_timestamp() -> u64: Returns the timestamp of the current block.

baals_get_block_index() -> u64: Returns the index (height) of the current block.

baals_get_input_data(ptr: u32, len_cap: u32) -> u32: Returns the raw payload of the transaction into contract memory.

Cryptography:

baals_hash_sha256(data_ptr: u32, data_len: u32, output_ptr: u32): Computes SHA256 hash.

baals_verify_signature(pubkey_ptr: u32, pubkey_len: u32, msg_ptr: u32, msg_len: u32, sig_ptr: u32, sig_len: u32) -> u32 (bool): Verifies a signature.

Inter-Contract Communication:

baals_call_contract(contract_id_ptr: u32, contract_id_len: u32, method_ptr: u32, method_len: u32, payload_ptr: u32, payload_len: u32, value: u64) -> u32 (result_len): Calls another contract with a payload and optionally transfers native value. Returns length of the result.

baals_read_call_result(ptr: u32, len_cap: u32) -> u32: Reads the result of a previous baals_call_contract into memory.

Event Emission:

baals_emit_event(topic_ptr: u32, topic_len: u32, data_ptr: u32, data_len: u32): Emits a log event that can be observed off-chain.

Error/Revert:

baals_revert(msg_ptr: u32, msg_len: u32): Terminates contract execution and reverts all state changes.

Capability-Based Security: BaaLS will adopt a capability-based security model, typical of WASI. The host (BaaLS runtime) explicitly grants specific permissions (capabilities) to a WASM module when it's loaded. For example, a contract might only be granted access to its own storage namespace, not the entire blockchain's storage.

4. Gas Metering & Resource Management
This is critical for preventing infinite loops or resource exhaustion in untrusted code.

Static Cost Analysis (or Dynamic Instrumentation):

Assign a fixed "gas cost" to each WASM opcode (e.g., i32.add = 1 gas, memory.grow = high gas cost).

During WASM module loading or just-in-time (JIT) compilation, the ContractEngine can instrument the WASM bytecode. This involves injecting "gas check" instructions at regular intervals (e.g., at the beginning of each basic block, before memory growth operations, before host calls).

wasmtime has built-in "fuel" metering capabilities that can be leveraged, where "fuel" is consumed and the execution traps if it runs out.

Host Call Metering: Gas costs for calling baals_ host functions (e.g., baals_storage_read, baals_call_contract) will be defined and deducted from the contract's gas budget. Storage operations are typically more expensive than CPU operations.

Memory Growth Cost: memory.grow operations incur a significant gas cost per page allocated.

Execution Limits: If the gas limit for a transaction is exceeded during WASM execution, the ContractEngine traps, signalling to the Ledger that the transaction must be reverted.

Deterministic Gas: The gas cost for a given WASM module and inputs must always be the same.

5. Security Considerations
Sandboxing: WASM's inherent sandboxing is a major security feature, isolating contracts from the host system.

Determinism: Eliminates non-deterministic behavior that could lead to consensus failures or divergent states.

Gas Metering: Prevents DoS attacks by resource exhaustion.

Input Validation: Host functions must rigorously validate all inputs received from the WASM module to prevent exploits (e.g., invalid pointers, buffer overflows within the host).

Reentrancy (Mitigation): While not purely a WASM concern, the design of WASI and the inter-contract call mechanism should consider reentrancy. A "call stack" or single-entry model for contract calls can help mitigate this common vulnerability. BaaLS should explicitly define how concurrent calls are handled.

WASM Bytecode Validation: Strict validation upon deployment to prevent malicious or non-standard WASM.

6. Interaction Flow with Ledger & Storage
The Ledger module (specifically, the apply_block function) will be the primary caller of the ContractEngine.

When execute_contract_call is invoked:

The ContractEngine receives a mutable reference to the Storage instance. This Storage reference is then passed to the WASI host functions, so the contract's baals_storage_read/write calls directly interact with BaaLS's underlying data store, but scoped to the contract's namespace.

This ensures that contract state changes are directly reflected in the global ChainState and persisted along with the block.

State Atomicity: The ContractEngine itself does not commit state. It operates on a mutable view of the state provided by the Ledger. If the contract execution fails (e.g., runs out of gas, explicit baals_revert), the Ledger is informed and discards all changes made during that contract's execution, ensuring atomic block processing.

Integration with Canvas Contracts (The Seamless Pipeline):
Canvas Contracts Output: Canvas Contracts' primary output is an optimized WASM bytecode module (and potentially a JSON ABI describing its exported functions and events).

BaaLS Input: BaaLS's deploy_contract function accepts exactly this WASM bytecode. The generated Transaction payload from Canvas Contracts' deployment tooling would contain this WASM.

WASI-based Nodes: The visual nodes in Canvas Contracts that perform blockchain interactions (e.g., "Read Contract State," "Emit Event," "Call Another Contract") directly map to the baals_ WASI host functions defined in this blueprint. This provides a clear, consistent target for the visual programming model.

Developer Experience: A developer using Canvas Contracts would "build" their contract visually, click "Compile & Deploy to BaaLS," and Canvas Contracts' CLI/IDE would handle the WASM compilation, signing, and submission of the Transaction to a local or synced BaaLS node. BaaLS then takes over, executing the compiled WASM.

This deep dive into the BaaLS Smart Contract Module outlines how BaaLS will provide a robust, secure, and flexible environment for smart contracts, making it the ideal runtime for the visually-designed contracts from Canvas Contracts.
