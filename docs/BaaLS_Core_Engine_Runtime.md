Blueprint #1: BaaLS - Core Blockchain Engine Runtime
Purpose: To define the foundational, local-first, embeddable blockchain engine written in Rust, emphasizing its modularity, determinism, and WASM smart contract execution capabilities.

1. Core Modules (High-Level):

Module

Purpose

ledger

Core logic: block validation, state transition, and chain integrity. Ensures all operations adhere to blockchain rules (e.g., nonce, timestamp, transaction order, hash linking).

consensus

Defines the ConsensusEngine trait and provides implementations (PoA default, with plugin support for others). Manages block generation, validation, and finality rules.

storage

Abstracted persistence layer for blocks, transactions, and global/contract state. Backed by an embedded key-value store (sled or rocksdb).

runtime

The central orchestrator: connects storage, consensus, ledger, and contracts. Manages transaction mempool, block processing, and overall chain execution.

types

Defines the canonical, immutable data structures for the blockchain (e.g., Block, Transaction, ChainState, Address, Signature, ContractId). Ensures data consistency.

contracts

(Integrated) Manages the WASM smart contract sandbox and executor. Handles contract loading, execution, and interaction with BaaLS's state via WASI.

sync

(Optional) Manages lightweight peer-to-peer discovery (e.g., mDNS, libp2p-lite) and data synchronization (e.g., simple gossip protocol, one-shot sync) between BaaLS instances.

cli

(External, but critical) Provides command-line tools for running a BaaLS node, inspecting the ledger, managing wallets, injecting transactions, and deploying/interacting with contracts.

sdk

(External) Provides native language bindings (Rust, Go, JS) and FFI layers for programmatically embedding and interacting with the BaaLS runtime from diverse applications.

    B -- (Optional) Syncs Blocks --> J[Sync Layer]
    J -- Exchanges Blocks --> K[Other BaaLS Instances]
User/CLI/SDK: Initiates actions like submitting transactions or querying chain state.

Runtime: The primary interface. Manages a Mempool of pending transactions. Orchestrates the creation and validation of blocks by interacting with Consensus. When a block is processed, it passes transactions to the Ledger.

Consensus: Determines if a block is valid and, for designated minters, generates new blocks from the Mempool.

Ledger: Validates the structure and content of blocks, applies transactions, and manages the overall ChainState. For smart contract transactions, it delegates execution to the Contracts Engine.

Contracts Engine: Loads and executes WASM smart contracts securely. It has a controlled interface to read and write to the shared Storage layer, but only within the bounds of its designated contract state.

Storage: Provides the persistent, key-value storage for all blockchain data, including blocks, transactions, and the current state of both the chain and individual smart contracts.

State Transition: The deterministic process by which the ledger updates the chain's state based on block execution.

Sync Layer (Optional): Enables peer-to-peer communication to share blocks and synchronize ledgers with other BaaLS instances.

3. Key Interfaces:

🧱 Block Format (Canonical):

index: u64 — The block height (sequential number).

timestamp: u64 — Unix timestamp of block creation (critical for PoA).

prev_hash: String — Cryptographic hash of the previous block, ensuring a linked, immutable chain.

hash: String — Cryptographic hash of the current block's entire content (including header, transactions, and metadata), making it tamper-evident.

nonce: u64 — A number used to satisfy PoW conditions, or a simple counter for PoA.

transactions: Vec<Transaction> — A list of validated transactions included in this block.

metadata: Option<Map<String, Value>> — A flexible field for consensus-specific data (e.g., validator signatures, difficulty targets) or future extensions to the block.

🧾 Transaction Format:

sender: PublicKey — Cryptographic public key of the transaction initiator.

recipient: PublicKey — Cryptographic public key of the transaction's target. This could be another wallet address or a deployed smart contract's address.

amount: u64 — (Optional) A value being transferred, if BaaLS implements a native token or for generic value transfers.

signature: Signature — Cryptographic signature of the sender over the transaction content, ensuring authenticity and integrity.

payload: Option<Vec<u8>> — A raw byte payload. For smart contract calls, this will contain the WASM function call data (method name, arguments). For simple value transfers, it might be empty or carry arbitrary data.

metadata: Option<Map<String, Value>> — Flexible field for additional transaction-specific data (e.g., gas limits, nonces for sender accounts).

Philosophy: Designed to be maximally abstract and generic. It's a container for operations, not tied to a specific "currency." Contract operations are a primary use case for the payload field.

🪨 Storage Engine Blueprint:

Storage trait: Provides a clean abstraction over the underlying key-value store.

Rust

pub trait Storage {
    fn put_block(&self, block: &Block) -> Result<(), StorageError>;
    fn get_block(&self, hash: &str) -> Result<Option<Block>, StorageError>;
    fn get_latest_block(&self) -> Result<Option<Block>, StorageError>;
    fn get_chain_height(&self) -> Result<u64, StorageError>;

    // Generic key-value state for ledger and contract state
    fn put_state(&self, key: &[u8], value: &[u8]) -> Result<(), StorageError>;
    fn get_state(&self, key: &[u8]) -> Result<Option<Vec<u8>>, StorageError>;
    fn delete_state(&self, key: &[u8]) -> Result<(), StorageError>;

    fn put_transaction(&self, tx: &Transaction) -> Result<(), StorageError>;
    fn get_pending_transactions(&self) -> Result<Vec<Transaction>, StorageError>;
    fn clear_pending_transactions(&self) -> Result<(), StorageError>;

    // Transaction indexing for fast lookup
    fn index_transaction(&self, tx_hash: &str, block_hash: &str, tx_index_in_block: u32) -> Result<(), StorageError>;
    fn get_transaction_by_id(&self, tx_hash: &str) -> Result<Option<(Block, Transaction)>, StorageError>;
}
Backed by: sled (default in-process, embedded KV store), with potential for rocksdb as an alternative for larger scale or specific performance needs. The Storage trait makes this swap seamless.

⚖️ Consensus Interface:

ConsensusEngine trait: Defines the common interface for any consensus mechanism.

Rust

pub trait ConsensusEngine {
    // Validates a proposed block against current chain state and consensus rules.
    fn validate_block(&self, block: &Block, chain_state: &ChainState) -> Result<(), ConsensusError>;
    // Generates a new block, including selecting transactions from mempool and sealing it.
    fn generate_block(&self, pending_transactions: &[Transaction], prev_block: &Block, chain_state: &ChainState) -> Block;
    // Optionally: methods for validator management, staking logic, difficulty adjustment, etc.
}
Default: Proof-of-Authority (PoA) - a simple implementation where a single, trusted entity (the BaaLS instance itself or a configured "authority") is responsible for generating blocks. Blocks are generated based on a time interval or when the mempool reaches a certain size.

Pluggable later: PoS (Proof-of-Stake), PoW (Proof-of-Work, e.g., for simple local puzzle solving), CRDT (for eventual consistency in decentralized data structures).

⚙️ Contract Engine Interface (Detailed):

ContractEngine trait:

Rust

pub trait ContractEngine {
    // Deploys a new WASM contract module to the chain. Stores the WASM bytes and returns a contract ID.
    fn deploy_contract(&self, deployer: &PublicKey, wasm_bytes: &[u8], init_payload: &[u8], storage: &dyn Storage) -> Result<ContractId, ContractError>;
    // Executes a contract call, modifying the provided current_state (which is a view of storage).
    fn execute_contract_call(&self, contract_id: &ContractId, sender: &PublicKey, payload: &[u8], storage: &mut dyn Storage) -> Result<ContractExecutionResult, ContractError>;
    // Executes a contract call in a read-only mode, without state changes.
    fn query_contract(&self, contract_id: &ContractId, payload: &[u8], storage: &dyn Storage) -> Result<Vec<u8>, ContractError>;

    // Provides a sandboxed environment for WASM runtime.
    fn get_wasm_runtime(&self) -> &dyn WasmRuntime;
}

pub trait WasmRuntime {
    // Basic WASM execution capabilities.
    fn instantiate(&self, wasm_bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<WasmInstance, WasmError>;
    fn call_function(&self, instance: &WasmInstance, func_name: &str, args: &[WasmValue]) -> Result<Vec<WasmValue>, WasmError>;
    // ... WASI host function registration for storage, crypto, logging, etc.
}
Runtime: wasmtime or wasmer – Rust-native WASM runtimes chosen for their performance, security, and embeddability.

WASI (WebAssembly System Interface): Crucial for enabling smart contracts to interact deterministically with BaaLS's host environment. This includes:

Storage Access: Functions for contracts to read/write their persistent state via BaaLS's Storage layer.

Cryptographic Primitives: Hashing, signature verification.

Logging: For contract debugging and event emission.

Inter-contract Calls: Mechanism for one contract to call another.

Contract Loading: WASM modules are loaded from the local filesystem (for pre-deployed) or registered and stored on-chain via deployment transactions.

7. Runtime (Central Coordinator - Detailed):

The Runtime struct acts as the public API for the BaaLS engine. It manages the lifecycle of the blockchain.

Key Owned Components: Arc<dyn Storage>, Arc<dyn ConsensusEngine>, Arc<dyn ContractEngine>, Mempool.

Responsibilities (Expanded):

Transaction Management: Receives Transaction objects, validates their basic structure (signature, format), and adds them to a thread-safe Mempool.

Block Production (PoA): On a defined schedule or when the Mempool reaches a threshold, it calls consensus.generate_block() to create a new block.

Block Processing: For newly generated or synced blocks:

Calls consensus.validate_block() to ensure it adheres to consensus rules.

Iterates through block.transactions.

For each transaction:

Performs basic transaction validation (e.g., sender balance, nonce).

If it's a contract call, invokes contract_engine.execute_contract_call() passing the payload and a mutable view of the state.

If it's a native value transfer, updates balances via the Ledger module.

Updates the overall ChainState and persists the new block and state changes via Storage.

Querying: Provides methods for external SDKs/CLI to query blocks, transactions, and contract states.

8. Build Philosophy (Expanded):

Determinism: Absolutely paramount. Achieved by:

No reliance on external randomness or non-deterministic OS calls during core logic.

Strict control over WASM runtime environment (no floating-point operations by default, consistent memory allocation).

All state transitions are pure functions of the previous state and the current transaction.

Locality: Designed for zero-network mode by default. Network syncing is an opt-in feature, not a core dependency. This allows BaaLS to run in isolated environments.

Embeddability: Built as a Rust crate (libchain) that can be easily linked into other Rust applications or compiled into a shared library (.so, .dll, .dylib) or even WASM itself (for browser environments) for integration with other languages.

Simplicity: The core ledger logic is kept minimal: 1 block = 1 atomic state update. Avoids unnecessary complexity to maintain high performance and auditability.

Extensibility: Core components like Consensus and ContractEngine are defined as Rust traits, enabling easy plug-in of alternative implementations without modifying the core BaaLS engine.

Compatibility & Synergy with Canvas Contracts:
BaaLS and Canvas Contracts are a match made in heaven, representing two critical layers of a powerful, accessible, and language-agnostic blockchain development stack:

BaaLS as the "Runtime Target" for Canvas Contracts:

Direct Deployment: Canvas Contracts' visual IDE or CLI can directly compile a visual graph into an optimized WASM module and deploy it to a running BaaLS instance (local or remote, if sync is enabled).

Seamless Execution: The WASM smart contracts generated by Canvas Contracts are precisely what BaaLS's ContractEngine is designed to execute. BaaLS provides the secure, deterministic, and sandboxed environment for these visually-designed contracts to run.

Local Development Environment: Developers using Canvas Contracts can use a local BaaLS instance as their rapid prototyping and testing environment, allowing for quick iterations without needing to deploy to a public testnet.

Shared Vision of Language Agnosticism:

Complementary Strengths: Canvas Contracts provides the visual design and multi-language compilation layer. BaaLS provides the universal WASM execution runtime layer. Both projects embrace WASM as the lingua franca for smart contracts, breaking free from proprietary blockchain DSLs.

Developer Freedom: A developer can design 80% of their contract visually in Canvas Contracts, implement a highly optimized or specialized 20% in Rust (compiled to WASM), and then seamlessly deploy and run this hybrid contract on BaaLS.

Enhanced Tooling & User Experience:

Visual Deployment & Monitoring: Canvas Contracts' visual deployment tools can interface with BaaLS's SDKs and CLI to manage deployed contracts. The Canvas Contracts visual monitor can pull real-time state and event data from BaaLS, offering an intuitive view of contract execution on the local ledger.

Integrated Testing: The BaaLS runtime can power Canvas Contracts' simulation and testing suite, providing accurate gas estimation and deterministic execution results for visually designed contracts.

Component Ecosystem: "Canvas Components" (reusable nodes/sub-graphs) could potentially package not just visual logic but also specific BaaLS WASM contract interface definitions, making them truly plug-and-play.
