Deep Dive Blueprint: BaaLS Transaction & Mempool
Purpose: To define the structure, cryptographic integrity, validation rules, and lifecycle of transactions within BaaLS, and to detail the design and management of the mempool (transaction pool) where unconfirmed transactions reside.

Relationship to BaaLS Core:

Runtime: Receives transactions (from SDKs/CLI), performs initial validation, and adds them to the Mempool. It also queries the Mempool to collect transactions for a new block proposal.

Consensus: Requests batches of transactions from the Mempool for block generation (generate_block).

Ledger: Performs comprehensive validation of transactions within a block (apply_block) and removes confirmed transactions from the Mempool.

Storage: The Mempool often uses the Storage layer for persistence (though it can be in-memory with optional persistence for crash recovery).

Core Principles:

Integrity: Transactions must be tamper-proof after creation.

Authenticity: The sender of a transaction must be verifiably identified.

Non-Repudiation: Once a transaction is signed and broadcast, the sender cannot deny having sent it.

Determinism: Transaction validation must be entirely deterministic.

Efficiency: Mempool operations (add, remove, select) must be fast to ensure smooth throughput.

Anti-Spam/Resource Control: While not monetarily expensive, mechanisms must exist to prevent unlimited resource consumption from malicious or erroneous transactions.

1. The Transaction Format (Refined from Core Blueprint)
This is the canonical structure that will be serialized, hashed, and signed. All fields must have a deterministic serialization order.

Rust

pub struct Transaction {
    pub hash: String,          // Unique identifier: hash of the canonical transaction data (computed after signing)
    pub sender: PublicKey,     // Public key of the account initiating the transaction
    pub nonce: u64,            // Incremental counter for the sender's account, preventing replay attacks
    pub timestamp: u64,        // Unix timestamp of transaction creation (for ordering/expiration in mempool)
    pub recipient: Address,    // Target of the transaction (wallet address or ContractId)
    pub payload: TransactionPayload, // The core data/logic of the transaction
    pub signature: Signature,  // Cryptographic signature of the sender over the transaction hash
    pub gas_limit: u64,        // Maximum gas units this transaction is allowed to consume
    pub priority: u8,          // (Optional) Priority level for mempool ordering (e.g., 0-255)
    pub metadata: Option<Map<String, Value>>, // Flexible field for extra data (e.g., memo)
}

// Address can be a wallet or contract
pub enum Address {
    Wallet(PublicKey),
    Contract(ContractId),
}

// Payload defines what kind of operation the transaction performs
pub enum TransactionPayload {
    // Basic value transfer (if BaaLS has a native token)
    Transfer {
        amount: u64,
    },
    // Smart contract deployment
    DeployContract {
        wasm_bytes: Vec<u8>,       // The WASM bytecode
        init_payload: Option<Vec<u8>>, // Data for the contract's initialization function
    },
    // Smart contract function call
    CallContract {
        method_name: String,       // Name of the WASM function to call
        args: Vec<Vec<u8>>,        // Serialized arguments for the function (e.g., via a standard ABI)
    },
    // Arbitrary data (e.g., for logging immutable application data)
    Data {
        data: Vec<u8>,
    },
    // ... other transaction types as BaaLS evolves
}
2. Canonical Transaction Serialization
Before hashing and signing, a transaction must be serialized into a deterministic byte array.

Method: Use a compact, deterministic serialization library like postcard or bincode in Rust.

Order: All fields within Transaction and its nested enums (Address, TransactionPayload) must be serialized in a fixed, predefined order. Maps (metadata) must be sorted by key.

Purpose: Ensures that hash(data) for the same transaction content always produces the identical hash across all nodes, which is fundamental for signature verification and chain integrity.

3. Cryptographic Signature & Verification
Algorithm Choice:

Ed25519 (Recommended): A modern elliptic curve digital signature algorithm.

Benefits: Highly secure, fast for both signing and verification, fixed-size signatures, constant-time operations (resisting side-channel attacks), and widely adopted in modern crypto (e.g., many blockchains use it). It is available via the ed25519-dalek crate in Rust.

(Alternative) secp256k1 (used by Bitcoin/Ethereum): Also viable, but Ed25519 often preferred for new projects due to its simplicity and security properties.

Key Management:

PublicKey: Derived deterministically from the private key.

Signature: The fixed-size output of the signing algorithm.

Rust crates from RustCrypto (e.g., signature, ed25519-dalek) will be used for robust, audited cryptographic primitives.

Signing Process:

Create a Transaction object.

Canonicalize the transaction (excluding the hash and signature fields themselves, as they depend on the signing process) into bytes_to_sign.

Compute tx_hash = hash_function(bytes_to_sign) (e.g., SHA256 or Blake3).

Sign tx_hash using the sender's private key with Ed25519 to produce signature.

Set transaction.hash = tx_hash and transaction.signature = signature.

Verification Process:

Receive a Transaction object.

Extract sender.public_key, signature, and transaction.hash.

Reconstruct bytes_to_sign from the transaction's canonical representation (excluding hash and signature).

Recompute computed_hash = hash_function(bytes_to_sign).

Verify signature against computed_hash using sender.public_key with the Ed25519 verification algorithm.

Ensure computed_hash == transaction.hash. If any check fails, the transaction is invalid.

4. Transaction Verification Flow (Initial Stage - Runtime / Mempool)
When a transaction is first submitted to BaaLS:

Basic Format Check: Is the Transaction struct well-formed?

Signature Validity: Perform cryptographic signature verification using sender.public_key and the canonical transaction data. If invalid, reject immediately.

Syntactic Validity:

Are all required fields present?

Are string lengths within limits?

Is gas_limit within reasonable bounds?

If TransactionPayload::DeployContract, is wasm_bytes a valid WASM binary (initial simple checks, full WASM validation occurs during block application by ContractEngine)?

If TransactionPayload::CallContract, are method_name and args well-formed?

Anti-Replay/Nonce Check (Mempool specific):

Retrieve the expected next nonce for sender from the current tip of the chain (read-only from Storage).

If tx.nonce is less than or equal to the expected nonce, reject (already processed or replay attempt).

If tx.nonce is higher than expected_nonce + 1, potentially queue as a "gap" transaction (waiting for missing prior nonces) or reject depending on mempool policy. For simplicity, initially, only expected_nonce + 1 might be accepted.

Duplicate Detection: Check if a transaction with the exact tx.hash already exists in the Mempool. If so, ignore (already received).

Mempool Insertion: If all initial checks pass, add the transaction to the Mempool.

Note: Full semantic validation (e.g., sufficient sender balance, actual contract logic execution) is performed by the Ledger module when the block containing the transaction is applied to the chain, ensuring determinism and atomicity.

5. Mempool (Transaction Pool) Design
The Mempool is an in-memory (with optional persistence for quick restarts) temporary storage for valid, unconfirmed transactions.

Data Structure:

A primary HashMap<TransactionHash, Transaction> for quick lookup and duplicate checking.

A secondary BTreeMap<PublicKey, BTreeMap<u64, TransactionHash>> to track transactions by sender and their nonce. This allows quick retrieval of transactions for a specific sender in correct nonce order.

Maximum Size & Eviction Policies:

Configurable Size Limit: A maximum number of transactions or total memory usage (e.g., 10,000 transactions or 100MB) for the Mempool.

Eviction (if full): When the Mempool reaches its limit and a new transaction arrives:

Least Priority First: Remove transactions with the lowest priority flag.

Oldest First: Remove transactions with the oldest timestamp.

Least Gas Limit First: Remove transactions requesting the least resources.

Expiry (Long-term eviction): Transactions that remain in the Mempool for too long (e.g., 24 hours) might be automatically removed if they aren't getting picked up by blocks.

Insertion Logic:

Perform initial Transaction Verification Flow.

If valid, insert into the HashMap and the BTreeMap by sender/nonce.

If the Mempool is full, apply eviction policy.

Removal Logic:

When a block is successfully applied by the Ledger, the Runtime instructs the Mempool to remove all transactions included in that block.

Transactions whose nonce is less than or equal to the new current nonce of any sender (updated after block application) should also be removed (as they are now "old" or invalid).

Transaction Selection for Block Proposal (Consensus interaction):

Consensus will request a batch of transactions from the Mempool.

Prioritization: The Mempool provides transactions ordered primarily by priority (highest first), then by timestamp (oldest first within same priority), and grouped by sender to ensure nonces are sequential.

Resource Limits: Consensus will take transactions until the BlockGasLimit or BlockSizeLimit is reached.

6. Transaction Fee Model (for BaaLS)
As discussed, BaaLS aims for "very cheap" or effectively "zero" end-user fees.

No Monetary Transaction Fee (by default):

The Transaction format includes a gas_limit field, which is crucial for the internal resource metering by the ContractEngine and Ledger.

However, there is no gas_price field (or it's set to a fixed, internal unit value of '1').

Users are not expected to attach a "fee" in native tokens to get their transaction processed faster.

Internal Resource Metering:

The gas_limit acts as a hard cap on the computational effort (CPU cycles, memory, storage operations) a transaction can consume.

If a transaction's execution (especially a smart contract call) exceeds its gas_limit during Ledger.apply_block(), it will revert, and all state changes for that transaction (and potentially the entire block) will be discarded.

Mempool Prioritization (Non-Monetary):

The optional priority field in the Transaction struct allows applications to signal intent. A BaaLS instance might, for example, assign higher priority to "critical sensor data" transactions over "diagnostic log" transactions. This priority is internal to the application/node's policy, not a market mechanism.

Oldest transactions are generally prioritized to prevent indefinite waiting.

Anti-Spam: The combination of gas_limit (even if "free") and the configurable Mempool size/eviction policies serves as the primary anti-spam mechanism. A user cannot infinitely submit high-resource transactions if they exceed the gas_limit or if the Mempool simply drops them due to capacity.

7. Error Handling
Define specific TransactionError enum variants (e.g., InvalidSignature, NonceMismatch, MempoolFull, InvalidPayload, GasLimitExceeded).

These errors are returned by submit_transaction and handled by the Runtime or originating SDK.

This deep dive into the BaaLS Transaction and Mempool provides a robust framework for managing the lifecycle of data changes on the ledger, ensuring security, order, and efficient processing while aligning with the "very cheap gas fees" philosophy.
